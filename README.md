Kaggle Competition: Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

The Challenge from Kaggle: 
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. 
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictie model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (ie name, age, genger, socio-economic class, etc)

There are two datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled 'train.csv' and the other is titled 'test.csv'. Train.csv contains details of a subset of the passengers on board and reveals whether they survived or not. Test.csv contains similar information but does not reveal whether they survived or not. This is what I hope to predict.
